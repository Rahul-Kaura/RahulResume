Experience
Ciocca Center Innovation Fellow, Santa Clara University Sep 2024 - June 2025
• Selected for a prestigious interdisciplinary program with a 20% acceptance rate, leveraging GPT-based NLP
models to perform sentiment analysis on student perspectives regarding third spaces on campus.
• Implemented data visualization using Seaborn for insightful analytics, scikit-learn’s classification models
(Logistic Regression, Random Forest) for categorizing student belonging, sustainability initiatives, and service
accessibility on campus.
• Collaborated with SCU faculty from the Innovation and CS departments to prototype, test, and launch a
campus-wide digital platform that addresses student needs, resulting in actionable insights and improved
engagement, including gathering feedback from 70 percent of students supporting the need for a third space on
campus and leading a petition signed by over 600 students to allocate funding for its development.
Co-Founder and CTO, RoomieConnectAI Aug 2023 – Present
• Spearheaded the design and implementation of a graph-based recommendation system powered by graph
neural networks, integrating social media APIs (Facebook Graph API, LinkedIn API) for personalized roommate
recommendations.
• Led development with team of two software engineers, achieving rapid growth with 600+ users across 5+
colleges within six months by leveraging a fine-tuned LLaMA-2 model integrated with Azure OpenAI services
and graph database technology to enhance user matching, optimize search algorithms, and improve system
efficiency. Implemented personalized recommendation algorithms and trust-based graph networks to connect
users based on lifestyle preferences, interests, and verified profiles, resulting in a seamless and secure user
experience.
Projects
AI Class, Developer Aug 2022 – May 2024
• Built an AI-driven virtual classroom integrating CNNs for Image Processing, Developed image recognition
models using transfer learning with pre-trained ResNet and Inception networks, along with data augmentation,
background subtraction, and edge detection techniques on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and custom annotated educational
datasets to automate grading and enhance learning for 1,000+ students.
GPT Financial News, Developer July 2024 – Nov 2024
• Created an end-to-end LLM model with self-attention mechanisms and transformer architecture to deliver
real-time financial news insights, leveraging matrix multiplications, vector spaces, eigenvalue
decomposition, and singular value decomposition (SVD) for data dimensionality reduction.
Email Spam Differentiator, Developer Sep 2024 - Jan 2025
• Engineered text classification models to classify emails as spam or not spam using TF-IDF Vectorizer and
CountVectorizer to convert email text into numerical feature vectors, and Logistic Regression for classification.
• Utilized CountVectorizer to represent the frequency of words in emails, capturing term importance through
tokenization and n-grams, and TF-IDF to weigh terms by their significance across the dataset. Achieved a 92
percent accuracy by optimizing hyperparameters with GridSearchCV and implemented K-Fold
Cross-Validation to increase model accuracy.
